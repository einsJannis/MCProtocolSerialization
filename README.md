# This repository

This repository was created after I recogniced that writing a Minecraft server would be a bit difficult, 
so I could just create a library for the Minecraft networking protocol.
And I never finished this so yeah...

# MCProtocolSerialization
This is a kotlinx.serialization based serialization lib for the minecraft server protocol
